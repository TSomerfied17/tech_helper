# tech_helper

Tech Helper is a tech support Slack app including FAQ solutions to aid internal HQ staff and reduce workload for our Tech & Innovation Team.

## Description

Tech Helper can be called by mentioning the app in a Slack channel publically, or by using a slash command within any Slack for private interactions.

- The user is asked which system they would like support with.
- Once a choice is selected a list of actions is offered in a select menu.
- The user then receives some troubleshooting instructions or the option to submit a support ticket.

This is useful as it encourages the user to resolve their own issue, and if this is not possible they are sent to a form which will ask relevant questions to help our Tech team resolve their issue more easily when they get to it.
